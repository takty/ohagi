# Ohagi


## Why Ohagi?

Ohagi was built to allow flexible management of CMS post data etc. without a database engine. The concept of Ohagi is offering file-based data management and making it easier for database users to maintain and manage data.

Inspired by [Filebase](https://github.com/tmarois/Filebase), [Flywheel](https://github.com/jamesmoss/flywheel), and [Flinetone](https://github.com/fire015/flintstone).
